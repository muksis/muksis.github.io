# Portfolio

## Description
Portfolio with my projects. As of now, the portfolio website and projects are built with HTML, CSS, and JS. I also used Bootstrap and Formspree as well as a responsive CSS grid to make this website.  

## How to run
Clone the repository and simply open the file index.html in your preferred browser or just click [here](https://muksis.github.io/muksis.github.io/).

## Roadmap of future improvements
Add projects on ReactJS.
